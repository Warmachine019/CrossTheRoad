# CrossTheRoad
Crossy Road but in Python!
Game uses the ⬆️⬇️keys as controls!
The 20x40 rectangles are used to represent vehicles as the turtle library does not have a car shape yet.
The vehicles are generated randomly on the screen and move from right to left.
The player has to avoid all the vehicles and reach the top of the screen.
The game restarts from the beginning but the pace of the cars slightly increases to make the game slightly challenging!
The scoreboard keeps track of your score.
